Please refere to the following [GIST](https://gist.github.com/jparciga/83341911fbc8cd716be12af50c0e496a) for further instructions

# Mini-Challenge 1: Core Concepts and Styling

## Before you start:
1. Read carefully [the instructions for the project](https://gist.github.com/jparciga/83341911fbc8cd716be12af50c0e496a), please make sure that you clearly understand all the requirements.
2. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/wdonet/react-certification-2021). Please make sure that your new repo is publicly accesible.

> **NOTE:* You should use the provided codebase only as a guide for structuring your application. Feel free to add, remove, or change anything if you consider it necessary.*

## The challenge:
1. Create the UI layout for your app, it should include the following elements:
  - 1.1 Header: Similar to the one in our [demo app](https://react-certification-2020.netlify.app/). For now, the search field, theme toggle, login button, and other navigation links should be disabled, i.e., you only need to create the corresponding UI elements without the functionality.
  - 1.2 Content: The content view corresponding to the section that will be renderered (in this case, the Home View).
2. Create the **Home View** and display the list of items from [this mock file](https://gist.github.com/jparciga/1d4dd34fb06ba74237f8966e2e777ff5).
3. Apply css styles to your components using the [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) approach.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The header is rendered correctly.
- [ ] A list of videos obtained from a mock file is displayed in the **Home View**.
- [ ] CSS styles are applied correctly using the styled-components approach.

## Bonus Points
- [ ] No warnings or errors are logged in the browser console.
- [ ] The UI is responsive

# Mini-Challenge 2: Intro to Testing

## Answer the following questions first
1. Using `create-react-app`, what do we need to set up for testing?
2. What components are worth to test in your development?
3. Can you apply TDD once you already created components?

## The Challenge

> **NOTE:* Apply TDD as much as you can.*

1. Find any sub-routine, extract that logic into a separate file and test it out.
2. Run test coverage and save results into a .txt file at ./ - root level. Can you make the total coverage to be above of 60%?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Meaningful test cases were implemented for components and sub-routines logic.
- [ ] All the test cases were successful.

## Bonus Points
- [ ] Test coverage is above 60%.
